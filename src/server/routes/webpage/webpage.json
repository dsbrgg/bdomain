  "text": "Thanks for visiting this humble corner of the web. I'm a software engineer with a professional background in web development, mainly as a backend engineer. Here you can check eventual blog posts that I intend to be posting around diverse themes that I enjoy. This website also hosts my most up to date resume which you can also download to keep the reference. I might also be adding more stuff here as I intend to use this website to add portfolio in general and do experiments for the web. Have a good one! :)"
